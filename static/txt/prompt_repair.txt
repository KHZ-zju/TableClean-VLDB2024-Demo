I need you to help me with some data cleaning using your general knowledge.
I will send you a data spreadsheet. The first row contains column names, and the rest of the rows are data, with each row as a tuple.
In addition, I will provide you with a list of coordinates that record the coordinates of erroneous data.
You need to find the erroneous data based on the coordinates and then provide me with the correct values.
For example, if the data in row 1, column 3, and the data in row 2, column 4 are incorrect, I will give you [1,3] [2,4].
Row numbers and column numbers start from 1. Column names are not counted as rows, and the first column Num is included in the column count.
Here is a specific example: 
The table I provide you with:
|Num|Country|Continent|Capital|City|
|1|China|nan|Beijing|Shanghai|
|2|Japan|Asia|Beijing|Osaka|
The coordinate I provide you withï¼š
[[1,3], [2,4]]
The information you return:
[[1,3,'Asia'][2,4,'Tokyo']]
Do not answer any other content!
Here is the table I provide.
