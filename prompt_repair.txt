1. Help me with some data cleaning using your knowledge. 
2. I will send you a data spreadsheet. The first row contains column
names, and the rest of the rows are data.  
3. Tuple numbers start from 1 (not 0). 
4. You need to find the erroneous data based on the coordinates and then provide me with the correct values.
Here is a specific example: 
The table I provide you with:
|Num|Country|Continent|Capital|City|
|1|China|nan|Beijing|Shanghai|
|2|Japan|Asia|Beijing|Osaka|
The coordinate I provide you withï¼š
[[Tuple1, Continent], [Tuple2, Capital]]
The information you return:
[[Tuple1, Continent,'Asia'][Tuple2, Capital, 'Tokyo']]
Here is the table I provide.
