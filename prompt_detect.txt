1. Help me with some data cleaning using your knowledge. 
2. I will send you a data spreadsheet. The first row contains column
names, and the rest of the rows are data.  
3. Tuple numbers start from 1 (not 0). 
4. Analyze each tuple one by one and determine if there are any errors
in the data. Output a set of coordinates that reflect the positions of 
the erroneous data.
Here is a specific example. The table I provide you with:
|Num|Country|Continent|Capital|City|
|1|China|None|Beijing|Shanghai|
|2|Japan|Asia|Kyoto|Osaka|
The information you return: 
[Tuple1, Continent] - Reason: There is an error in tuple 1. 
The continent of China should be Asia, not None.
[Tuple2, Capital] - Reason: There is an error in tuple 2. 
The capital of Japan should be Tokyo, not Kyoto.
Here is the table I provide you with:
